# Personal Hobby Blog
A website for documenting my progress on my various hobbies. The Y2K aesthetic is the big thing right now, and that's my main inspiration for this website as I'm intending to have the design invoke late 2000s - early 2010s era web design and blogs for nostalgia.

This project is meant to very casual and for fun, so the code and methods used will be outdated and/or deprecated. But, at the same time that also kind of ties in to the intent for this project.
