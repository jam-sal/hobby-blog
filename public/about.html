        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This website will be dedicated to documenting and archiving my progress in my various hobbies and interests.</p>
        <p>
          Through documenting it in the style of old blogs from the late 2000s - early 2010s with some modern design sensibilities,
          I'm hoping the nostalgia I'm trying to invoke this way will help with motivation and holding myself accountable to making consistent progress.</p>
        <p>
          This is also meant to be a place outside of my social media pages to post my creations and progress without external input,
          so this can be a casual, low-stakes place where external validation won't affect my motivation.
        </p>
        <p>Pages may be added as I gain new interests depending on how much I'm committed to sticking with it and how much it'll clutter the layout.</p>
